# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
A human resources (HR) analytics dashboard created using Power BI is a visual representation of HR-related data that provides insights and analysis to support decision-making and strategic planning within an organization.


The dashboard is built using Power BI, a business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft, which allows users to create interactive and customizable data visualizations.

The HR analytics dashboard typically includes a variety of HR metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide a comprehensive view of HR-related data. These metrics and KPIs may include employee demographics, such as age, gender, and tenure; employee turnover and retention rates; recruitment metrics, such as time to fill a position and cost per hire; employee performance metrics, such as performance ratings and goals achievement; compensation and benefits data, such as average salary, bonus, and benefits utilization; and other HR-related data points.

The dashboard may include various types of visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tables, and maps, to effectively represent the data and provide insights at a glance. Users can interact with the dashboard by filtering and drilling down into the data, allowing them to explore the data in more detail and identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

The HR analytics dashboard can be used by HR professionals, managers, and executives to monitor and analyze HR-related data, identify areas of concern or improvement, make data-driven decisions, and track progress towards HR goals and objectives. It can also help identify potential HR challenges and opportunities, optimize HR processes, and align HR strategies with overall organizational objectives.

In summary, an HR analytics dashboard created using Power BI is a visual representation of HR-related data that provides insights, analysis, and visualization of key HR metrics and KPIs to support decision-making and strategic planning in an organization.
